## Brief Bio
My extensive teaching, research and consulting experience that commenced a decade before my PhD candidature. My career spans two decades of experience, knowledge and acquisition of skills. Experience working in a number of statistical research areas, statistical consulting, statistical teaching and academic practice has provided me with versatility to conduct research, collaborate, supervise and teach across a broad range of statistics disciplines. These include medical statistics, primary industries, ecological statistical research and neuroscience. I am enthusiastic to continue with contributions with my expertise and develop methods in these areas with continual expansion into other areas of statistics applications.
